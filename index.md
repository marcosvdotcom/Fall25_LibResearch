A quick, one-stop shop to build, or refresh, your skills in doing academic research using library licensed databases and resources.

Session goals:
- To help you develop stategies and skills to turn your research ideas into formal research question(s)
- To understand the key parameters of a ready-to-research question versus one that needs a bit more development 
- To understand at a base level how AI should be used in the research process
- To make sure you know where to go for next steps, either for research or more support
