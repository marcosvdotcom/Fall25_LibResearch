#Tips on Reviewing articles:

Key thing is to read Abstract, if itâ€™s on topic, move on to the introduction, findings, and conclusion. Then dive in fully. This will look like this > in terms of narrowing down from everything you find to what you really in-depth. For really good papers, check out their works cited AND search them in google to see the papers that have been published since that cite the article of note. 

Similarly, for papers that are very on topic, note their keywords. You may want to update your search list if you notice some possible improvements.
