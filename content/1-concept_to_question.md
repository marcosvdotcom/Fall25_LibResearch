## Concept to Question Digital Worksheet

Work through the following questions, using the linked form to share your answers. Sections in _italics_ indicate there is a spot on the form for you to share your response. 

1. What ideas do you have for your research topic? 
	- _Write down 2 or 3 different research topic ideas in the form_
1. Use Primo Research Assistant to explore your topic (3 to 5 queries)
1. Use your AI agent of choice to explore your topic, if you're not sure which to use just use ChatGPT (aim for 3-5 queries) 
	- _What do you notice about the similarities and differences with these tools? Share your thoughts in the form._ 
1. Identify 3 key words or phrases you want to search in library databases 
	- _Share your keywords in the form._
1. Go to google scholar and search your key words or phrases
	- use the facets on the left side of the screen to limit by date and other parameters
	- use related by to find content with similar key words
1. Repeat your search in a disciplinary database such as [ERIC](https://www.google.com) or [TBD](TBD.com)
	- _What do you notice about the similarities and differences between the disciplinary database and google scholar? Share your thoughts in the form_
1. Refine and repeat your search, looking for:
	- Articles with a lot of citations (prominence in field)
	- Articles in the right time frame (be mindful of dates and timeframes, if youâ€™re using sources that are older than 10+ years, there likely needs to be some kind of reason for that)
	- Articles that address your concept or topic, either entirely or in the case of inter-disciplinary research, in part 

Pro-Tip: _You can also search google scholar for AI served articles - this is handy to see what a cited article might actually be.

Based on what you find, you will likely be updating and refining your parameters, especially with respect to dates and keywords. This is normal as you find out more information!
