## Concept to Question Digital Worksheet

Work through the following questions, using the linked form to share your answers. Sections in _italics_ indicate there is a spot on the form for you to share your response. 

1. What ideas do you have for your research topic? 
	- _Write down 2 or 3 different research topic ideas in the form_
1. Use [PRIMO Research Assistant](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/researchAssistant?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID%3AUID) to explore your topic (3 to 5 queries)
1. Use your AI agent of choice to explore your topic, if you're not sure which to use just use ChatGPT (aim for 3-5 queries) 
	- _What do you notice about the similarities and differences with these tools? Share your thoughts in the form._ 
1. Identify 3 key words or phrases you want to search in library databases 
	- _Share your keywords in the form._
1. Go to google scholar and search your key words or phrases
	- use the facets on the left side of the screen to limit by date and other parameters
	- use related by to find content with similar key words
1. Repeat your search in a disciplinary database such as [ERIC](https://www.proquest.com/eric)
	- as before, use the facets on the left side of the screen to limit by date and other parameters 
	- _What do you notice about the similarities and differences between the disciplinary database and google scholar? Share your thoughts in the form_
1. Refine and repeat your search, looking for:
	- Articles with a lot of citations (prominence in field)
	- Articles in the right time frame (be mindful of dates and timeframes, if youâ€™re using sources that are older than 10+ years, there likely needs to be some kind of reason for that)
	- Articles that address your concept or topic, either entirely or in the case of inter-disciplinary research, in part 

Pro-Tip: _You can also search google scholar for AI served articles - this is handy to see what a cited article might actually be._

Based on what you find, you will likely be updating and refining your parameters, especially with respect to dates and keywords. This is normal as you find out more information!
