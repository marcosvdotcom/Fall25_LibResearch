# Worksheet Fields

What ideas do you have for your research topic? 
Use Primo Research Assistant to explore your topic (3 queries)
Use your LLM of choice to explore your topic (3 queries) 
What do you notice about the similarities and differences with these tools? 
Identify 3 key words or phrases you want to search (share in form).
Go to google scholar and search your key words or phrases
	_check related by
	_check cited by 

Can also search google scholar for AI served articles - handy to see what a cited article might actually be (note to self, don’t forget academic AI databases to share)

Repeat your search in a disciplinary database such as ERIC or TBD
	_explore related
	_AI tools?
What do you notice about the similarities and differences between the disciplinary database and google scholar?
Based on what you find, you will likely be updating and refining your “ready to research” parameters, especially with respect to Dates. This is normal as you find out more information!
<Download a citation manager (Zotero) to help you keep track of it alll>
Refine and repeat your search, looking for:
	Articles with a lot of citations (prominence in field)
	Articles in the right time frame (be mindful of this as it often gets newer researchers, if you’re using sources that are older than 10+ years, there likely needs to be some kind of reason for that)
	Articles that address your concept or topic, either entirely or in the case of inter-disciplinary research, in part
