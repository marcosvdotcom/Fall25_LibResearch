The fastest way to evaluate research is to read the article's Abstract. If it is on topic, move on to the Introduction, Findings, and Conclusion. If after that it still seems like a good article, then dive into fully reading it. 

For really good papers, check out their works cited AND search them in google scholar to see the papers that have been published since that cite the article of note. 

Similarly, for papers that are very on topic, note their keywords. You may want to update your search list if you notice some possible improvements. You can also search a strong match paper in Google Scholar and see it's Related By and Cited By articles, which show articles that match keywords or subjects, or that formally cite the given article.
