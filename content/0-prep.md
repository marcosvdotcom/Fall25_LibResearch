# Goals: 

- To develop your research ideas into a formal research question(s)
- To understand the key parameters of a ready-to-research question versus one still in the oven
- To understand at a base level how AI should be used in the research process

## Getting inspired

Where to look/how to come up with reserach ideas

## Stages of research question formation 

“Needs more time in the oven”: general topic or too specific topic, not clear about dates of interest, unsure what your position/thought on the topic is, semantic search terms versus key words

Ready to research: topic, dates of interest/relevance, a sense of what your own hypothesis is (necessary to watch out for confirmation bias!), key words, foundational concepts, seminal findings/key touch points

## AI and Research

- [ ] To understand at a base level how AI should be used in the research process
    - [ ] Good for: brainstorming, exploring foundational concepts, explaining concepts or findings you don’t understand, having a narrative of a discipline versus assembling your own
    - [ ] Bad at: accurate citations, factual information, copyright, original content 
    - [ ] Challenge: Ask AI about a topic you know well, and see how accurate the information is. Now ask it about something you know nothing about, how would you go about verifying the information of the topic you don’t know? Spoiler alert, it is hard to do!
