## Getting inspired

Inspiration for great research can come from almost anywhere. 

Here's some ideas to help you brainstorm:

- Topics in the news or on social media
- A problem or challenge you or someone you know is facing
- A concept or practice you've just learned about it from a class or fellow student

## Good to Great Research Questions 

A good research question has the following qualities:

- Clearly defined in terms of scope, which might include types of people impacted or locations of interest
- A defined timefrmae of interest and/or relevance
- Identifiable key words that you can use to search of

Q:_What makes a great research question?_

A: Something you feel passionate about! Having a research topic that that have some passion for will help sustain you through the sometimes tiring process of searching for articles and evaluating results. The more you care, the more enjoyable the research process and the better an outcome! Don't be afraid to switch topics as you explore your initial ideas and get a sense of what really excites or interests you about a topic. 

## Stages of research question formation 

Hallmarks of “Needs more time in the oven”: 
- very general topic ("vaping") or too specific topic ("does teen vaping cause distracted driving in the state of Idaho?")
- not clear about dates of interest (search results contain a huge range of dates, with no particular rhyme or reason)
- unsure what your position/thought on the topic is (researchers often arrive at our questions with some implicit assumptions and maybe even a hypothesis in mind)
- sentence level search terms versus key words (library databases typically do better with key subject words, versus "sentence style" searches)

Ready to research topic: 
- topic is well defined ("teen vaping in rural states")
- clearly defined dates of interest/relevance (limiting searches to results from the last 10 years)
- a sense of what your own hypothesis is ("teens in rural states have higher rates of vaping due to less support for addiction counseling and services")
- key words

_Elements that come with repeated searching and diving into a topic:_
- familiarity with foundational concepts and research ("National surveys show 25% of college students have tried tobacoo vapes by the time they graduate high school")
- seminal findings/key touch points (At the end of a succesful research process, you should have hopefully identified key, foundational papers. These papers can typically be identified by having a high number of citations).
