## How should AI should be used in the research process?

First you should consult whatever the boundaries set by your professor for your particular class and assignment is. Some faculty may have policies against using any AI during the research or writing process. 

In general, AI is good for: 
- brainstorming
- exploring foundational concepts
- explaining concepts or findings you don’t understand
- giving an overall narrative of a discipline versus you gathering sources and assembling your own

As of 2025, it is still pretty bad at:
- accurate citations
- reliably factual information
- copyright
- original content 

_AI Challenge:_ 

1. Ask AI about a topic you know well, and see how accurate the information is. 
1. Now ask it about something you know nothing about, how would you go about verifying the information of the topic you don’t know? Spoiler alert, it is hard to do!

## Getting Good Results with AI

Strategies for prompts

What results you get from any generative AI are hugely dependent on how you phrase and construct your questions. Because AI works in a probabalistic manner, which means it is determing which words are most likely to occur following previous words and weighting how those results are shown based on hundreds of thousands of virtual training hours, how you phrase, order, and logicially construct your question makes a big impact on the type of results you get back.
