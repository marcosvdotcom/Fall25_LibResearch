## How should AI should be used in the research process?

First you should consult whatever the boundaries set by your professor for your particular class and assignment is. Some faculty may have policies against using any AI during the reserach or writing process. 

In general, AI is good for: 
- brainstorming
- exploring foundational concepts
- explaining concepts or findings you don’t understand
- giving an overall narrative of a discipline versus you gathering reserouces and assembling your own

As of 2025, it is still pretty bad at:
- accurate citations
- reliably, factual information
- copyright
- original content 

_Challenge:_ 

1. Ask AI about a topic you know well, and see how accurate the information is. 
1. Now ask it about something you know nothing about, how would you go about verifying the information of the topic you don’t know? Spoiler alert, it is hard to do!
